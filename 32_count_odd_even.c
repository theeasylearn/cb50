/*
    count no of odd and even value into integer array
    steps
    1) create & initialize array as numbers
    2) create variable odd, even and store 0 into it
    3) check value at 1st position is odd or even
       if(number%2==0)
        even = even  + 1
       else
        odd = odd + 1
    4) check value at 2nd position is odd or even
       if(number%2==0)
        even = even  + 1
       else
        odd = odd + 1
    5) check value at 3rd position is odd or even
       if(number%2==0)
        even = even  + 1
       else
        odd = odd + 1
